This is the respository for my IB CS SL project for the Internal Assessment. 

The project itself is an event scheduling app developed in Android Studio. Users can add, delete, edit, locally save, and categorize events. 

Categories are customizable with name and respective color. Events will be displayed in order of time, and past events are not shown in main app page.
